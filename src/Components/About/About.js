          A quiz is a quick and informal assessment of student knowledge.
          Quizzes are often used in North American higher education environments
          to briefly test a studentsâ€™ level of comprehension regarding course
          material, providing teachers with insights into student progress and
          any existing knowledge gaps. A quiz is much shorter than a traditional
          test or exam and is rarely impactful.
